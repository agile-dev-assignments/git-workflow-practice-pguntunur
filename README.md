## Article: [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/how-to-write-disposable-code-in-large-systems)

## What I found interesting
This article addresses the belief that good code is easy to extend. I find it interesting because the author explains how a better metric for good code is whether it's easy to delete, not that it is easy to extend. And although he puts forth multiple arguments and provides different examples, the main justification is that good code is code that is easy to maintain. However, instead of writing code that can be re-used (because introducing changes to code often requires rewriting), we should layer and structure our code in a way that likely-to-change parts can be deleted, and new code can be written easily. Of course, the author does go in-depth about his points, and I recommend you to give this article a read!
